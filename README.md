## A Nowhere Festival 2018 Review from a guy who was physically abused by the organization of that festival. 

1. He was been physically harmed with toxic poison which was injected into his body to put him into a coma 

2. He then was kidnapped 70 kilometers away into a hospital where he woke up, chained to the bed, on both his arms, his belly and his legs. 

3. He had tu return to the festival without shoes, without money, without mobile phone, 70km during the hottest season of summer, while his dog was still at the festival 

4. They kidnapped the dog, they took him from the car illegally, they broke inte the car of the victim and searched it, they found nothing, their expectations where not met at all 

5. He had to pay the Taxi driver 90€ to get back to the festival, he had to lie to the driver to convince him that he would drive him even without having any money on him 

6. He then was kicked out of the festival immediatly after he rescued his dog 6. He was followed by the securities of that festival for several kilometers out of the festival 

7. He was attacked again by the same security guards that put him into a coma, while he was relaxing and coming down from that horrible experience, while sitting at a river many kilometers away from the festival 

8. He had monetary losses of more than 300€ (Festival Ticket 140€ + Taxi to get from the hospital back to rescue his dog at the festival 90€ + Gasoline to get to the festival and back 110€) because of that action, until today the organization refused to apologize nor admit any msitake, until today nobody paid me my financial losses 

9. The victim has been completely left alone after that incident, nobody offered him any help to cope with that issue, he is now afraid to ever go and visit any festival again 

10. The victim has lost all his trust into the european society, which apparently supports that kind of abuse by permitting it to happen
